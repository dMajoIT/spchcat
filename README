# Spchcat

A tool to convert speech in audio files or live microphone input into text transcriptions, using [Coqui's open-source speech to text library](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT).

## Usage

To build the tool, download [a binary release of STT](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/download/v1.1.0/native_client.tflite.Linux.tar.xz) and extract it into a folder. Then run the following makefile command from inside the folder holding this repo (where `../stt_download` is the path to the folder you extracted the binary release to):

```bash
make spchcat LINK_PATH_STT=-L../stt_download
```

This should now build a `spchcat` binary file. To run it, use something like this:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../stt_download ./spchcat --model ../model.tflite --audio ../audio/4507-16021-0012.wav
```

The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can be removed if you install the `.so` files from the binary release folder in a system path like `/usr/lib`. The Colab notebook shows how to download the model and example audio files.
